# Auto-clicker
Script that emulates mouse clicks for Bash.

## Dependencies
This script needs **_xdotool_** to work! But don't worry, the script checks, and if it doesn't find xdotool, it asks if you want to install it on your system, how covenient!

## Usage
First things first, allowing the script execution with:

``` $ sudo chmod +x auto-clicker.sh ```

After this, simply type:

``` $ ./auto-clicker.sh ```

Enjoy your extra clicks! :D

To end the program simply press the "x" key on your keyboard in the terminal.
