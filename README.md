# Auto-clicker
Scripts that emulates mouse clicks for Windows and Linux.

## Dependencies
The Bash script needs **_xdotool_** to work! But don't worry, the script checks, and if it doesn't find xdotool, it asks if you want to install it on your system, how covenient!
The Windows script has no dependencies, as it uses system calls to work.

## Usage
### Windows
  - You only need to compile the code and run the generated .exe file in your favorite terminal.
### Linux
  - First things first, allowing the script execution with:

  ``` $ sudo chmod +x auto-clicker.sh ```

  After this, simply type:

  ``` $ ./auto-clicker.sh ```

Enjoy your extra clicks! :D

To stop the program simply press the "f6" key on your keyboard in the terminal.
