# Auto-clicker
Script that emulates mouse clicks for Bash.

## Dependencies
This script needs **_xdotool_** to work! The script also verifies if it's installed in your system before running, and suggests the correct way to install it, if it doesn't find it.

## Usage
First things first, allowing the script execution with:

``` $ sudo chmod +x auto-clicker.sh ```

After this, simply type:

``` $ ./auto-clicker.sh ```

Enjoy your extra clicks! :D

To end the program simply press the "x" key on your keyboard in the terminal.
